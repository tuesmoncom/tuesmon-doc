[[setup-tuesmon-scripts]]
Setup using **tuesmon-scripts**
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**tuesmon-scripts** primarily follows the standard installation process, but makes it more automatic. If
something goes wrong in the process, you should try to fix it by following the manual deploy process.

**tuesmon-scripts** always installs a specific (the most recent) version of Tuesmon (tuesmon-front and tuesmon-back)


Important notes about **tuesmon-scripts**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In an alpha state, and has not been heavily tested in different environments.
- Designed to work with tuesmon-vagrant (see next section of this documentation).
- Does not support reprovisioning (updating) at this moment, that is still in development.
- Does not support installation with root user.
- The installation is not 100% ready for production.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Freshly installed and updated Ubuntu 16.04
- Bash shell
- Git


Setup server-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have a fresh and updated Ubuntu 16.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/tuesmoncom/tuesmon-scripts.git
$ cd tuesmon-scripts
$ bash setup-server.sh
----


Setup development-like environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setup is much like the previous one but with a few differences:

- It does not install services like nginx, as they are only necessary for production
- It sets all hostnames to localhost to easily run everything on localhost

Make sure you have a fresh and updated Ubuntu 16.04 machine or virtual image:

[source, txt]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/tuesmoncom/tuesmon-scripts.git
$ cd tuesmon-scripts
$ bash setup-devel.sh
----

[[setup-tuesmon-vagrant]]
Setup using **tuesmon-vagrant**
-----------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**tuesmon-vagrant** offers a Vagrantfile which makes it easy to turn on a fully provisioned
virtual machine. **tuesmon-vagrant** uses **tuesmon-scripts** for its provisioning scripts.


Important notes about using **tuesmon-vagrant**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The installation is not 100% ready for production, it is designed for use as a demonstration.
- Does not support reprovisioning at this moment.
