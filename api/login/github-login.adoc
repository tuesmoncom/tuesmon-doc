[NOTE]
===============================
To get the GitHub code you have to follow the first step _Redirect users to request GitHub access_
described in link:https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#web-application-flow[GitHub Documentation for
Developers - API - OAuth - Web Application Flow].

Tuesmon needs privileges to get the user email from Github so you have to use the scope +user:email+.
