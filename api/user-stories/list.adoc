To list user stories send a GET request with the following parameters:

include::../generated/user-stories-list-cmd.adoc[]

The HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON list of link:#object-userstory-detail-list[user story list objects]

The results can be filtered using the following parameters:

- *project*: project id
- *milestone*: milestone id
- *milestone__isnull*: (true|false) if you are looking for user stories associated with a milestone or not
- *status*: status id
- *status__is_archived*: (true|false)
- *tags*: separated by ","
- *watchers*: watching user id
- *assigned_to*: assigned to user id
- *epic*: epic id
- *role*: role id
- *status__is_closed*: (true|false)
- *exclude_status*: status id
- *exclude_tags*: separated by ","
- *exclude_assigned_to*: assigned to user id
- *exclude role*: role id
- *exclude epic*: epic id

 the "exclude_" params work excluding from the response the results with which they match.
