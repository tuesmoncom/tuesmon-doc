To list issues send a GET request with the following parameters:

include::../generated/issues-list-cmd.adoc[]

The HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON list of link:#object-issue-detail-list[issue detail list objects]

The results can be filtered using the following parameters:

- *project*: project id
- *status*: status id
- *severity*: severity id
- *priority*: priority id
- *owner*: owner user id
- *assigned_to*: assigned to user id
- *tags*: separated by ","
- *type*: issue type id
- *role*: role id
- *watchers*: watching user id
- *status__is_closed*: (true|false)
- *exclude_status*: status id
- *exclude_severity*: severity id
- *exclude_priority*: priority id
- *exclude_owner*: user owner id
- *exclude_assigned_to*: assigned to user id
- *exlcude_tags*: separated by ","
- *exclude_type*: issue type id
- *exclude role*: role id

the "exclude_" params work excluding from the response the results with which they match.

include::../generated/issues-filtered-list-cmd.adoc[]

The results can be ordered using the order_by parameter with the values:

- *type*
- *severity*
- *status*
- *priority*
- *created_date*
- *modified_date*
- *owner*
- *assigned_to*
