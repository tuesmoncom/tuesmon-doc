To edit issue custom attributes send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the issue custom attribute id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

When the update is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-issue-custom-attribute-detail[issue custom attribute detail object]
