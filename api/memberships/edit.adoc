To edit memberships send a PUT or a PATCH specifying the membership id in the url.
In a PATCH request you just need to send the modified data, in a PUT one the whole object must be sent.

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON link:#object-membership-detail[membership detail object]
