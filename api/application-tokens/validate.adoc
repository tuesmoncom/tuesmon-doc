To validate an authorization code send a POST request with the following data:

- *application*: the application id for the requested token
- *state*: an unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. The API will include this value when the validation process is completed so the final app can verify it matches the original one.
- *auth_code*: the authorization code received on previous the steps.

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 and the response body is a JSON link:#object-application-token-cyphered-token[cyphered token object]
