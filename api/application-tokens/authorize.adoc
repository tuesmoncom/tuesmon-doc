To request an authorization code send a POST request with the following data:

- *application*: the application id for the requested token
- *state*: an unguessable random string. It is used to protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. The API will include this value when the validation process is completed so the final app can verify it matches the original one.

When the creation is successful, the HTTP response is a 200 and the response body is a JSON link:#object-application-token-authorization-code[authorization code object]
