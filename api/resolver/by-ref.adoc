To resolve an object if we don't know its type we have to use `ref` GET parameter:

include::../generated/resolver-ref-cmd.adoc[]

The response body is a JSON object containing the project and the story, task or
issue id.

include::../generated/resolver-ref-output.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
.Incompatibility between GET params
=====================================================================
Be careful because `ref` is inconpatible with `us`, `task` and `issue`
parameters in requests with multiple resolutions.
