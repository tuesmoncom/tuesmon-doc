To list tasks send a GET request with the following parameters:

include::../generated/tasks-list-cmd.adoc[]

The HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON list of link:#object-task-detail-list[task list objects]

The results can be filtered using the following parameters:

- *project*: project id
- *status*: status id
- *tags*: separated by ","
- *user_story*: user story id
- *role*: role id
- *owner*: owner id
- *milestone*: milestone id
- *watchers*: watching user id
- *assigned_to*: assigned to user id
- *status__is_closed*: (true|false)
- *exclude_status*: status id
- *exclude_tags*: separared by ","
- *exclude_role*: role id
- *exclude_owner*: owner id
- *exclude_assigned_to*: assigned to user id

the "exclude_" params work excluding from the response the results with which they match.
