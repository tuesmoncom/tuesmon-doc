How to upgrade Tuesmon
====================
:toc: left

The Tuesmon platform is developed on github. For consistency you should always remain
in time with the *stable* branch of git or use the last major version of each component.

**No packaged version of Tuesmon is available at this moment.**

Default upgrade process
-----------------------

Frontend application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/tuesmon-front-dist
git checkout stable
git pull
----

Backend application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[WARNING]
====
Run as user `tuesmon` or whatever user you use, do not run this code as `root` to avoid errors.
====

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/tuesmon-back
git checkout stable
workon tuesmon
git pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

[WARNING]
====
If you have some contrib plugins installed you should to upgrade them before the next step.
====

[source,bash]
----
python manage.py migrate --noinput
python manage.py compilemessages
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
----

In case you are using circus as the process manager:

[source,bash]
----
circusctl reload tuesmon
----

In case you are using systemd as the process manager (recommended since tuesmon 4.0):

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart tuesmon
----

In case tuesmon-celery is configured reload it too.

With circus:

[source,bash]
----
circusctl reload tuesmon-celery
----

With systemd:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl restart tuesmon_celery
----

1.9.0 > 1.9.1
-------------

Copy your conf.json from `tuesmon-front-dist/dist/js/conf.json` to `tuesmon-front-dist/dist/conf.json`.

Remove the following folders `dist/fonts`, `dist/images`, `dist/js`, `dist/locales`, `dist/styles`, `dist/svg`.

Download the latest version of plugins following their installation instructions.


1.9.1 > 1.10.0
--------------

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.


1.10.0 > 2.0.0
--------------

Follow the default process.

This version upgrades Django to 1.9, so if you overwrote the DB settings in `tuesmon-back/settings/local.py` you have to change the DB backend to use the default.

So, change...

[source,python]
----
# In Tuesmon <= 1.9
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "transaction_hooks.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
        (...)
----

to:

[source,python]
----
# In Tuesmon >= 2.0
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        (...)
----


2.0.0 > 2.1.0
--------------

Follow the default process.

2.1.0 > 3.0.0
-------------

[IMPORTANT]
.Extra step for instances with gogs plugin installed
====

Tuesmon contrib gogs plugin has been moved to tuesmon core so if you installed the plugin you must uninstall it first:

- In `tuesmon-back/settings/local.py`
    * Remove `tuesmon_contrib_gogs` from your `INSTALLED_APPS`
    * Remove the `PROJECT_MODULES_CONFIGURATORS["gogs"]` setting added

- In `tuesmon-front/dist/conf.json` remove `/plugins/gogs/gogs.json` from the `contribPlugins` section
- In `tuesmon-front/dist/plugins` remove the folder `gogs`
====

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.

Now project templates can be sorted and a new permission has been added to allow users to add comments (instead of using the __modify object permission__ for this purpose). The fixtures must reloaded using:

----
cd tuesmon-back
workon tuesmon
python manage.py loaddata initial_project_templates --traceback
----

3.0.0 > 3.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the default process.

If you want to have svg thumbnail images install `cairo` library.

----
apt-get install cairo
----

Upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 system to Ubuntu 16.04
------------------------------------------------

To upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 you have to follow the official Ubuntu process:

[source, txt]
----
$ sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
$ sudo do-release-upgrade -p
----

Then you have to upgrade to the new postgres version maintaining the old data:
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-9.5 postgresql-contrib-9.5
$ sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-doc-9.5 postgresql-server-dev-9.5
$ sudo pg_dropcluster 9.5 main --stop
$ sudo pg_upgradecluster 9.3 main
$ sudo reboot
----

Then you have to use the circus service from ubuntu.
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo pip uninstall circus pyzmq
$ sudo apt-get install circus
$ sudo mv ~/conf/circus.ini /etc/circus/conf.d/tuesmon.ini
----

Rebuild your virtualenv
[source, txt]
----
$ rmvirtualenv tuesmon
$ mkvirtualenv tuesmon -p /usr/bin/python3.5
$ cd ~/tuesmon-back
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

Reboot the system
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo reboot
----


3.0.0 > 3.1.0
-------------

[IMPORTANT]
.PostgreSQL >= 9.4 is needed
====
in this release PostgreSQL > 9.4 is the officially recomended version because all JSON columns will be migrated to JSONB to reduce the db disk space usage and improve performance.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Changes to settings for REST_FRAMEWORK throttling.
====
If you have modified your `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings, you have to care about the changes introducted in the new version:

. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"]` you must handle the fact
  that `anon` and `user` scopes settings have been renamed and split into
  `anon-write`, `anon-read`, `user-write` and `user-read`.
. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"]` we have added new scopes of
  throttling (by default set to `None`), they are `login-fail`, `register-success`,
  `user-detail`.
. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES"]` the new default throttle
  class is `tuesmon.base.throttling.CommonThrottle`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Changes to settings because celery upgrade from 3.x to 4.x.
====
We have migrated to celery 4, and split the configuration in two different
files. Therefore if you have configured any celery settings in your
`settings/local.py` you must move them to the `settings/celery_local.py`
file. Besides, before update the workers and tuesmon-back, ensure that your tasks
queue is completely empty because the tasks format isn't compatible (if you
can't stop your service during the upgrade, you have to follow the instructions
given by celery creators here:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-4.0.html#upgrading-from-celery-3-1).
====

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.
